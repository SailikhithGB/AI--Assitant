**Password Security:**
üîê Use unique passwords for every account
üîê Make passwords at least 12 characters long
üîê Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
üîê Consider using passphrases (4+ random words)
üîê Use a password manager to generate and store passwords

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
üì± Enable 2FA on all important accounts
üì± Use authenticator apps over SMS when possible
üì± Keep backup codes in a safe place
üì± Consider hardware security keys for highest security

**Email Security:**
üìß Be suspicious of unexpected emails
üìß Don't click links from unknown senders
üìß Verify requests for personal information
üìß Check sender addresses carefully
üìß Use separate emails for different purposes

**Device Security:**
üíª Keep software and apps updated
üíª Use device lock screens
üíª Enable automatic updates
üíª Install antivirus software
üíª Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities

**Financial Security:**
üí≥ Monitor bank and credit card statements
üí≥ Set up account alerts
üí≥ Freeze your credit when not needed
üí≥ Use secure payment methods online
üí≥ Check credit reports regularly

**Privacy Protection:**
üîí Review privacy settings on social media
üîí Limit personal information sharing
üîí Use VPN for public Wi-Fi
üîí Be cautious about app permissions
üîí Regularly clean up old accounts"""

**Creating Strong Passwords:**

**Method 1: Passphrases**
- Use 4+ random words: `Coffee#Mountain$River!Dance`
- Easy to remember, hard to crack
- Add numbers and symbols between words

**Method 2: Character Substitution**
- Start with a phrase: "I love pizza and movies"
- Transform: `IL0v3P1zz4&M0v!es`
- Replace letters with numbers/symbols

**Method 3: Password Patterns**
- Create a base: `MySecure!`
- Add site identifier: `MySecure!FB23` (Facebook)
- Change the identifier for each site

**Password Don'ts:**
‚ùå Don't reuse passwords across sites
‚ùå Avoid personal information (birthdays, names)
‚ùå Don't use dictionary words
‚ùå Avoid simple patterns (123456, qwerty)
‚ùå Don't share passwords with others

**Password Managers:**
‚úÖ Generate unique passwords automatically
‚úÖ Store passwords securely
‚úÖ Sync across devices
‚úÖ Popular options: Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass

**Testing Password Strength:**
- Most password managers include strength meters
- Check if your passwords have been breached
- Aim for "Very Strong" or equivalent ratings

**Emergency Planning:**
- Keep master password written down securely
- Share emergency access with trusted person
- Have backup authentication methods
- Know how to recover accounts if locked out

**Quick Security Check:**
1. Are you using unique passwords? (Most important!)
2. Do you have 2FA enabled on important accounts?
3. When did you last update your passwords?
4. Are you using a password manager?

The dark web is a part of the internet that requires special software to access. While it has legitimate uses, it's also where cybercriminals often sell stolen data.

**How Your Data Gets There:**
üìä **Data Breaches** - Companies get hacked and data is stolen
üé£ **Phishing** - Criminals trick people into giving up information
üíª **Malware** - Software that steals data from infected devices
üè™ **Insider Threats** - Employees with access misuse information

**What Gets Sold:**
- Email addresses and passwords
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Personal documents
- Login credentials
- Financial information

**How to Protect Yourself:**
üõ°Ô∏è **Proactive Measures:**
- Use unique passwords for every account
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Keep software updated
- Be cautious with emails and links
- Monitor your accounts regularly

üîç **Monitoring:**
- Check haveibeenpwned.com regularly
- Set up account alerts
- Monitor credit reports
- Use identity monitoring services

‚ö° **If You're Compromised:**
1. Change passwords immediately
2. Enable 2FA if not already active
3. Monitor accounts for suspicious activity
4. Consider freezing your credit
5. Report identity theft if necessary

**Stay Informed:**
- Follow cybersecurity news
- Learn about latest scam techniques
- Keep security knowledge updated
